# Cat vs Dog Image Classifier using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset. The dataset contains a large number of images of cats and dogs which are labeled accordingly.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle at [https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data). It consists of a training set and a test set of images, each labeled as cats or dogs. 

**Note:** You will need to download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the appropriate directory before running the code.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies via pip:
pip install numpy opencv-python scikit-learn


## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cat-vs-dog-svm.git

2. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `dataset` directory within the cloned repository.

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd cat-vs-dog-svm



## Results

After running the classifier, the accuracy and other evaluation metrics will be displayed. Additionally, the classifier will save the trained model as a file for future use.
